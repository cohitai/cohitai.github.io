			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="loading"> Greetings</p>
			<p>If you're here, then it's highly likely that you wish to learn something about me..  You've landed at the right place !. An experienced contractual Data Scientist, I develop custumized AI solutions for my clients.  </p>
			<p>Arriving at your shores, I usually begin my journey by listening to you, sketching my impressions for a POW app, which I'll soon going to develop.</p>
			<p>A Machine Learning solution is for me as a picture to be painted. Understaning the business needs and scope of operations, I search for the right spot where AI could enhance your product to the next level. </p>
			<p>Analyzing your data, I slowly build a picture around it to make sense of it.  </p>
			<p> In Berlin I finalized two projects so far; NLP Recommandations engine & a computer vision 3D reconstruction optical system for plants analysis.</p>
